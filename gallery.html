<h2>Origin of the Legend</h2>

<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
<p>
This story taught me the importance of being responsible and helping my parents at home. I realized that being lazy can lead to negative consequences. The character of Pina reminds me that I should not take my family’s efforts for granted. Through this legend, I learned to appreciate the value of hard work and obedience. It inspired me to become more helpful and respectful in my daily life.
