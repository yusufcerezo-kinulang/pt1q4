Hi, my name is Yusuf Jev L. Cerezo, and in this website you will see my life. Now what may my life contain? Honestly I don't know much and forgot pretty much everything, but I'll try remembering for our sakes. Anyway, we'll be exploring my life, when I was born, what I played, what I enjoyed, what I learnt, what I've been through, and so on. Seems alot but don't worry, I'll make it short, again for our sakes.<br>
 A little more introduction: I want to be a mechanic. I pursue this by fixing stuff in our home, in school (anywhere basically) with the available materials and tools. But, what I mainly do to prove my wanted profession is by fixing and building my bikes. Right now I have a frame to build, but I can't build it right now due to lack of money and time.
